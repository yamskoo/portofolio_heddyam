          </div>
        </div>
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Context</h4>
        <p>TopSky-ATC, an air traffic management solution developed by <span class="mark">Thales</span>, currently ensures the safety of nearly <strong>40%</strong> of the <span class="mark">world’s airspace</span>.<br><br>
           Within the <span class="mark">Integration</span> team — responsible for ensuring integration, deployment, and supervision of releases — I worked on an internal tool dedicated to <span class="mark">building</span>, <span class="mark">distributing</span>, and <span class="mark">installing</span> product versions.
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Problem</h4>
        <p>The existing tool showed its limits: <span class="mark">security</span>-wise exchanges to improve, incomplete <span class="mark">traceability</span>, lack of <span class="mark">centralization</span>, and <span class="mark">manual, time-consuming</span> steps for integrators.</p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Goal</h4>
        <p><span class="mark">Design</span> and <span class="mark">deploy</span> a secure, automated pipeline based on <span class="mark">HTTPS</span> and <span class="mark">Artifactory</span> to publish and retrieve versions, while centralizing artifacts and strengthening traceability.</p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Missions</h4>

      <!-- Second experience -->
      <article class="entry reveal">
        <div class="when">Internship · Apr. 2024 – Aug. 2024 · Vélizy, FR</div>
        <div class="where pin">Industry 4.0 Engineer</div>
        <div class="badge">Thales AVS</div>
        <!-- Illustrative image (optional) -->

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Context</h4>
        <p>Thales Avionics, one of Thales’ largest <span class="mark">industrial sites</span> in France with over <strong>2,500 employees</strong>. I joined the <span class="mark">Industry 4.0</span> team directly attached to the plant.<br><br>
           My mission focused on evolving <span class="mark">digital production tools</span> with a dual focus: <span class="mark">supervision</span> of industrial equipment (benches, ovens, pumps, baths, etc.) and <span class="mark">collection</span> of the plant’s machines’ energy data.
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Problem</h4>
        <p>
           Two main challenges guided this internship:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An <span class="mark">industrial supervision</span> software experiencing <span class="mark">malfunctions</span> in display (unrecognized machines, inconsistent data, wrong states), complicating <span class="mark">real-time</span> monitoring for operators.</li><br>
          <li>The need to integrate machines into a new <span class="mark">energy collection</span> software to ensure reliable <span class="mark">consumption</span> reporting. This project aligned with the plant’s 2030 <span class="mark">carbon footprint</span> reduction roadmap, centralizing data to pilot energy consumption.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Goal</h4>
        <p>Improve the reliability of the <span class="mark">industrial supervision</span> software, and deploy a new energy collection tool, to guarantee <span class="mark">reliable data</span> reporting that is centralized and usable by operators and the plant.</p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Missions</h4>
        <p><span class="mark">Industrial supervision:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyze and fix malfunctions: machine connection failures, missing or inconsistent data, display errors.</li>
          <li>Optimize communication between equipment and PCs via a Siemens module (TCP/IP).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="mark">Data collection:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integrate machines into the new consumption collection tool.</li>
          <li>Verify the reliability and usability of energy data.</li>
          <li>Contribute to documentation and follow-ups on changes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Tools &amp; Methods</h4>
        <p>
        <span class="mark">Technical:</span> industrial supervision, TCP/IP protocols, Siemens module, energy collection software, Python (JSON file handling, multi-threading, MQTT), Bash.<br><br>
        <span class="mark">Methods:</span> direct interaction with operators, incremental analyze-and-fix approach.
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Results</h4>
        <p>Supervision software made more <span class="mark">robust</span> for operators (fewer errors and better consistency of machine data).</p>
        <p><span class="mark">Effective deployment</span> of the energy collection software, enabling automated and usable data reporting.</p>
        <p>Contribution to the <span class="mark">Industry 4.0 strategy</span> and to the 2030 carbon footprint reduction objectives of the Vélizy site.</p>

      <!-- Third experience -->
      <article class="entry reveal">
        <div class="when">Internship · Jun. 2022 – Aug. 2022 · Montrouge, FR</div>
        <div class="where pin">Assistant Business Engineering Team</div>

        </div>
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Context</h4>
        <p>CACEIS, a <strong>Crédit Agricole</strong> subsidiary specializing in financial services for institutional investors.<br> Based at the <span class="mark">headquarters</span> in Montrouge, I joined the <span class="mark">Business Engineering</span> team in charge of preparing and drafting files for <span class="mark">institutional clients.</span></p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Problem</h4>
        <p>The team had just deployed a new software, RFPdia, designed to <span class="mark">centralize</span> and <span class="mark">reuse</span> historical answers in order to gain efficiency and quality in the <span class="mark">production of future proposals.</span> <br>It still needed to be populated and organized to become fully operational.</p>
                  
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Goal</h4>
        <p>Contribute to the <span class="mark">deployment and adoption</span> of RFPdia by structuring existing data (past files) and optimizing their organization, so the team has a <span class="mark">rich, reusable base</span> when preparing future client proposals.</p>
        
        <h4 class="u-accent pin">Missions</h4>
        <p>
          Review and analyze <span class="mark">RFI/RFP</span> archives to sort, categorize, and import into RFPdia.<br><br>
          Structure data to <span class="mark">maximize relevance</span> and <span class="mark">facilitate reuse.</span><br><br>
          Participate in the <span class="mark">operational deployment</span> of RFPdia and support the Business Engineering team in its adoption.<br><br>
          Draft minutes to follow up on meetings and <span class="mark">key decisions.</span><br><br>
          Regular exchanges with teams abroad, strengthening my <span class="mark">cross-cultural communication</span> skills.<br>

      <!-- Fourth experience -->
      <article class="entry reveal">
        <div class="when">Since age 15</div>
        <div class="where pin">Other professional experiences</div>
        <div class="badge">+++</div>
        <p>Alongside my studies, I’ve taken on various <span class="mark">summer and extra jobs</span> that helped me develop a strong <span class="mark">service mindset, versatility, and work ethic.</span> I worked in retail (<strong>Coccinelle Express</strong>), hospitality (<strong>Holiday Inn Paris Montmartre</strong>), real estate (<strong>CAFPI</strong>), as well as in catering and events during seasonal missions.<br><br>
           These experiences—sometimes physically demanding or requiring high reactivity—taught me to <span class="mark">adapt quickly</span>, keep a positive attitude in <span class="mark">dynamic environments</span>, and always give my best. They echo the values I mentioned in my introduction: <span class="mark">rigor, responsibility, and perseverance.</span>
